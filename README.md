# Correct Change

Develop an application that given a UK Currency amount and the purchase price of a product, displays the change to be returned split down by denomination, largest first.
 
Example:
For a product price of £5.50 and payment received for £20, the application will output:
 
Your change is: (displayed within the console)
1 x £10
2 x £2
1 x 50p

* At least 10x unit tests
* Scalable code (what would happen if the pound change to euro?)
